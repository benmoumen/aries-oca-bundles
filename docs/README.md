# Aries OCA Bundles

This website (published from the [Aries OCA Bundles] GitHub repository) is
human- and machine-readable registry of published Overlays Capture Architecture
(OCA) Bundles to be used by Hyperledger Aries agents (issuers, holders and
verifiers).

[Aries OCA Bundles]: https://github.com/benmoumen/aries-oca-bundles
[Hyperledger AnonCreds]: https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/anoncreds

The OCA Bundles should follow the rules for [OCA for Aries RFC] OCA Bundles,
including the [OCA for Aries Style Guide RFC]. Each OCA Bundle must be accompanied
by some metadata about the credential, such as on what ledger the credential
schema and/or credential definition (CredDef) reside, and may be accompanied by the full OCA
Source data--Excel and JSON files. There are tools in the associated GitHub repository for
converting OCA Source to the Bundle to make it easier for contributors.
