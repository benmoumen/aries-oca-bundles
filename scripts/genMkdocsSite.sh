# This script is for generating the documentation structure from documents in the Aries OCA Bundles repository.
# This script is intended to run from a GitHub Action as part of updating the gh-pages branch and publishing the website
# The process is:
# - Delete the existing content of the /docs folder in this repo, leaving only `docs/assets`
# - Generate the Mkdocs navigation for the site and put it in place of the current mkdocs YML
# - For each folder that will be in the /docs folder of this rep0:
#   - For each file the is to be in the folder within the /docs folder
#     - Either directly copy, or copy with edits applied the source file to the /docs folder
# - Edits are needed to "fix" the links to work when the file is in the new place in the repo
# See the edits below for the types of changes needed. Usually, they are to change absolute
# links in the markdown documents to relative links in this folder, as well as to handle changes
# in where the docs are placed.
# 
# To find broken links:
# - Run mkdocs locally and click on links and images that result in 404s
# - Once you publish the docs, run a "broken link finder" tool to find others
# To find missing documentation files
# - Scan the /tmp folder for all .md files and see if you have them in the /docs folder
#   - a script to compare the list of .md files in /tmp and /docs is planned

# Have to be sure we're in the root folder of the repository
